=====

**A visualization tool for the nMNSD structure: decomposition using the the trapezoid method.**

This Matlab App allows the user to:
1) load a trained nMNSD structure,
2) load a set of parallel inputs,
3) visualize the related "trapezoids" and the crossing steps: "trapezoid space" (left) and related diagram of the inner state at the target neuron during the summation.

Using an example dataset, the program will show the "crossing steps" of the input spikes on the trapezoids, that is a simplified 
animation of the target summation mechanism. A useful tool for the tuning and the understanding of the internal 
operation of the structure.
