![LOGO](https://github.com/LCCN/Frontiers2020/blob/master/LOGO.png?raw=true "LOGO")  nMNSD trapezoid tool
=====

**A visualization tool for the nMNSD structure: the trapezoid method.**

This Matlab App allows the user to:<br />
1) load a trained nMNSD structure,<br />
2) load a set of parallel inputs,<br />
3) visualize the related "trapezoids" and the crossing steps: "trapezoid space" (left) and the related diagram of the inner state at the target neuron during the summation.
<br /><br />
Using an example dataset, the program will show the "crossing steps" of the input spikes on the trapezoids, that is a simplified 
animation of the target summation mechanism. A useful tool for the tuning and the understanding of the internal 
operation of the structure.
<br /><br />

GUIDE:<br />
1 - Launch nMNSD.mlapp (Matlab 2019b)<br />
2.  Import "nMNSD_parameters.mat" using the proper button<br />
3.  Load "NoGo_trial.mat" using the proper button, and then compare it with "Go_trial.mat".<br />
