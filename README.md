 **A visualization tool for the nMNSD structure: decomposition using the the trapezoid method.**

This Matlab App allows the user to load 
1) nMNSD structure
2) a set of parallel inputs, to visualize the related "trapezoids".

Using an example dataset, the program will show the "crossing steps" of the input spikes on the trapezoids, that is a simplified 
animation of the target summation mechanism. A useful tool for the tuning and the understanding of the internal 
operation of the structure.
